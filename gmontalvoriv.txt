Hey, I'm Gabriel Montalvo<p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. I am a network and computer security enthusiast, with a strong focus on developing open source applications and accessible security systems for the community.</p>
<p>After I finish my Bachelors I will continue my education and work my way to a masters degree in Cryptography.</p>
<p>As a student, I work on my projects on a daily basis, but I also like to do my own research on many different topics and keep my self up to date with other tools and software. I enjoy playing the piano. I find that learning new things like a new piece of music can really nurture the mind and in someway inspire me to make new things.</p>
If you would like to get in touch with me, whether it be for tech support, a business venture, or to just say hi, feel free to send me an email. My email address is: <a href="mailto:gabe.montalvo5@gmail.com">gabe.montalvo5@gmail.com</a>
